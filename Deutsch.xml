  <text id="TUTORIAL00" size="Lg">Welcome in the game Race To Mars. My name is Albert Solka and I’m a business advisor. I’ve been working in New Space industry for many years, so I know few tricks. Would you like to use my services?</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL01" size="Lg">Yes, I want to use the tutorial.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL02" size="Lg">No, turn off the tutorial.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL03" size="Lg">Here are your first steps in the game. Write down your name, name of the company and the country you would like to run it in.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL04" size="Lg">Now you see the main screen of the game. Here you will be hiring employees, developing space technologies and building your rockets.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL05" size="Lg">Here you can read your e-mails.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL06" size="Lg">Here you can always check the date, your account balance and amount of Prestige points.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL07" size="Lg">Prestige points show how your company is perceived in the industry and in media – you company’s reputation will change during the whole game.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL08" size="Lg">Prestige is a very important indicator in the game. You will find out how many aspects depend on Prestige level and how many elements can influence it.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL09" size="Lg">You have a good perspective on all your buildings from this point. Use mouse to move the camera.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL10" size="Lg">Administration building is the basic building where you will decide on the strategy of your company. Left-click on the building to enter it.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL11" size="Lg">Here you will manage few matters of the company, like Buildings.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL12" size="Lg">First building you will need is Research+Development.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL13" size="Lg">When having it you will be able to develop technologies, which you will later use in constructions at Assembly building.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL14" size="Lg">Buildings for Programs unlock development of specific technologies at R+D.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL15" size="Lg">Constructing some of buildings depends on constructing others.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL16" size="Lg">Try to plan reasonably the order of constructions. Remember that owning buildings and conducting work there always brings costs.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL17" size="Lg">My advice: start with building Research+Development and Vehicle Assembly. Read descriptions of all buildings to know all dependences.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL18" size="Lg">At Administration building you can manage employees.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL19" size="Lg">Here you can hire (and fire) engineers and Project Managers.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL20" size="Lg">Engineers and Projects Managers have skills and experience developed on different levels. Those levels influence time needed for projects and its costs, as well as employees’ payrolls.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL21" size="Lg">Employees will improve their skills and build experience during the game.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL22" size="Lg">It is best to hire employees when you already own some buildings and can assign them to tasks.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL23" size="Lg">Check out the option of hiring/firing employees and other functions.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL26" size="Lg">At Administration building you can also take marketing &amp; PR actions. At the moment you can organize a press conference here. You will be able to do that twice a year.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL27" size="Lg">You can also go through diverse reports. Come back here in the next turns.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL30" size="Lg">When you finish your actions for this month, end turn by left-clicking on the button. One turn equals one month.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL31" size="Lg">After ending each turn a window with month summary appears. Now plan your next steps.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL32" size="Lg">When you point on the building you can find out how many more months (turns) does it need to get finished.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL33" size="Lg">In the beginning of each press conference a list of topics will be presented to you. Three of them are chosen in advance, the rest 2 or 3 you can choose by yourself. In the future you will be able to choose from 6 propositions.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL34" size="Lg">Confirm chosen topics by left-clicking on the arrow at the bottom of the window.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL35" size="Lg">Each conference has 4 or 5 questions.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL36" size="Lg">The answers will appear after clicking with mouse. Before you do that read the question carefully. Time of your answer will be measured.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL37" size="Lg">The time for answer is unlimited but the quicker you answer the more interested are the journalists.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL38" size="Lg">If you wait more than 60 seconds, the journalists will lose interest.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL39" size="Lg">Time left for the current question is marked yellow.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL40" size="Lg">Time left for the current question is marked blue.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL41" size="Lg">Depending on how interested you kept the journalists, you may gain some additional Prestige points at the end of the conference.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL42" size="Lg">You can chose the answer in 2 ways: By clicking on the text of the answer you mark it and then confirm by clicking on the glowing arrow on the right. By clicking directly on the arrow at first you immediately confirm the answer.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL43" size="Lg">Now choose the answer.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL44" size="Lg">By answering each question you gain or lose Prestige points which are marked with a star.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL45" size="Lg">Each answer has one or few of those features: Eco, Friendliness, Power and Trust, which are marked with icons – point the icon to see its meaning.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL46" size="Lg">Green arrows indicate positive reception, red arrows indicate negative reception.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL47" size="Lg">Those features are transferred to Prestige points, so you will see only this score.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL48" size="Lg">Sometimes features balance each other out (some are positive, some negative), so you can get 0 Prestige points.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL49" size="Lg">Left-click on the window to continue and answer the rest of the questions. I’ll meet you at the conference summary.</text>
  <text id="TUTORIAL50" size="Lg">At the end of each press conference you will be informed by how many point your Prestige has changed.</text>

  <text id="RESEARCH_64_DESCRIPTION" size="Lg">A blended monopropellant based on nitrous oxide that is blended with fuel in a motor. Offers higher effectiveness than other monopropellants, however it's more difficult to handle.</text>
  <text id="RESEARCH_65" size="Lg">Igniters</text>
  <text id="RESEARCH_65_DESCRIPTION" size="Lg">Some combinations of fuels and oxidisers are non-hypergolic, therefore require chemical or electrical igniters to kick-start their rocket motors.</text>
  <text id="RESEARCH_66" size="Lg">Hydrocarbons</text>
  <text id="RESEARCH_66_DESCRIPTION" size="Lg">Hydrocarbon fuels are stable and far less hazardous than their hypergolic counterparts and still offer a reasonable efficiency in a rocket motor.</text>
  <text id="RESEARCH_67" size="Lg">Hypergolics</text>
  <text id="RESEARCH_67_DESCRIPTION" size="Lg">Hypergolic propellants are a class of fuels and oxidisers that ignite spontanously upon contact, therefore not needing specialised ignition mechanisms. However they are extremely toxic and hazardous.</text>

		Welcome in Race To Mars game.
		Current version does not include all the features, but there is a lot to try. First of all you can start developing your company by constructing buildings of your choice (once you have some, the others will be available as well). It is also possible to hire and fire engineers and Project Managers. After building Satallite Program you can research first technologies at Research+Development facility and then at Assembly Building you will be able to use them for producing components. In futures versions more researches will be available. The components may be used for constructing your first satellite. The satellite can be launched into orbit on a rocket, which you should buy at the Market. We are currently working on the possibility of building a rocket and using your own Launch Facility, so that should appear in one of the next builds. Later it will be possible to create different vehicles and equipment and to start new programs, which will present you with new features.
		In current version you may also: sign contracts for missions at National Space and Air Office, organize press conferences, educate your Project Managers at University, use the Bank and follow monthly reports.
		Have fun!
